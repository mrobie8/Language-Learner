# Language Learner
This project is a basic language learning website that aims to teach beginner English to Japanese speakers. Inspired by language learning platforms like Duolingo, the website incorporates interactive elements like games and progress tracking to enhance the learning experience. The primary goal is to make language learning engaging and effective for beginners.

Each lesson has multiple challenges and questions to test users' knowledge that must be completed before moving on. Users only get 2 incorrect answers before they have to start over. However, users can retake lessons as many times as they want.
*   **Guidebook:** A guidebook is available that reviews important phrases and grammar concepts for each lesson. The guidebook for the first unit focuses on introducing oneself and ordering at a cafe. The second unit focuses on asking questions and describing one's home.
*   **Progress Tracking:** As users progress through the lessons, visual indicators will appear on the main page to mark their progress.
